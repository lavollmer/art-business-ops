## Overview

The project's scope involved developing an artist operations application using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Vite. Additionally, I worked on using various features to help build out this application to include a frontend and backend server.

## The challenge

The challenge of the project was to create a space to have all business information for a creator to navigate.


## Process

1. Setup Vite, ReactJS, TailwindCSS
2. Setup structure of website - homepage, footer, header and navigation
3. Working on functionality of the navigation - setup useState, togglestate and added comments - very basic and NO styling
4. Added all functional components I wanted on my page

## Things that Need to Get Fixed

1. Navigation Sidebar - fix content, and close button
